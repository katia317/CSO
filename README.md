CIE includes equitable access to benefits and advancement opportunities. In order for employment to meet this threshold, individuals with disabilities must be eligible for the level of benefits and have opportunities for advancement that are similar to those for other employees who are not individuals with disabilities and who have similar positions.
CIE can only occur at integrated locations where employees with disabilities interact with other persons who are not individuals with disabilities (co-workers, supervisors, customers, general public) to the same extent as employees who are not individuals with disabilities and who are in comparable positions. Interaction must extend beyond job coaches or others who are associated with the provision of supports. Competitive Integrated Employment may occur in settings with a natural absence of customers or the general public such as work that occurs at a community business after traditional hours.

Residents receive a comprehensive individualized array of residential habilitation, personal support services and supports under the direction of a community support team within the local agency.  
  
*Three CILA models are defined below:*
- **Twenty-Four Hour CILA (60D)**
These homes have on-site shift staff available during all times when individuals are present. Staff provide both scheduled and unscheduled supports and services as needed by individuals.
- **Host Family CILA (60D)**
  Host Family CILA serves individuals with developmental disabilities in their own residence. Host families consist of one or more persons who are unrelated to the individual with a developmental disability and who are under contract with the provider agency to provide host family services. No more than two individuals with developmental disabilities may reside with any single host family.
  The two support models are:
  - **Standard Host Family**: a residence where the paid care giver(s) live on a full-time basis. Either the paid care giver(s) or individual served own, lease or rent the residence.
  - **Comprehensive Host Family**: may house either full or part-time paid care giver(s) in which individuals other than shift staff employees provide more than 50% of the residential coverage. The individual(s), care giver(s) or provider agency own, lease or rent the residence.
    *The difference between Standard and Comprehensive models is shift employees routinely share supervision, care and training responsibilities with the host family care giver(s) in the Comprehensive model.*
- **Intermittent CILA (61H, 62H or 63H)**
Typically serves individuals whose Personal Plan documents they do not require 24-hour, on-site staff presence and documents the situations in which individuals may safely be away from direct staff supervision. 24-hour, on-site staffing is not funded through Intermittent CILA. Intermittent Residential services in apartments or family homes have staff available on call 24 hours per day. On-call staff are available to provide both scheduled and unscheduled supports and services as needed by the individuals served and as specified in each individual's [Personal Plan](#personal-plan-pp).  

## Community Living Facility (CLF)
Serves Adult Waiver participants in a licensed residential setting. A Community Living Facility is not a nursing or medical facility and, to be eligible under the waiver, serves no more than 16 adults. There are 9 CLFs in the state.
CLF are residential settings that provide guidance, supervision, training and other assistance to adults with disabilities. The goal of community living is to help residents move into more independent living arrangements and stay engaged in society. Community living facilities can be houses or apartments that offer semi-independence and personal freedom to residents.

## Conflict of Interest Free Case Management
The Federal government regulations require states to separate case management from service delivery. Case management cannot be done by someone who: is a relative of the person served, is a direct provider of service, has a financial interest in a provider, or is employed by a provider. Case managers perform eligibility determinations, develop the Personal Plan, help families find providers, and monitor services.

## Convalescent Care
The care involved and the gradual return to health after an acute illness. To be considered for convalescent care, the individual must be discharged from a hospital setting. Usually convalescent care is obtained in a nursing facility setting. On occasion, an ICF/MR may be able to provide such care.

## Counseling (Individual and Group) (57U or 57G)  
*Note: This service is available only in the Adult Waiver.*
Counseling is a treatment approach in which a licensed professional meets with one or more individuals in ongoing periodic formal sessions and uses relationship skills to promote the individuals' abilities to deal with daily living issues associated with their emotional, cognitive, or behavioral problems using a variety of supportive and re-education techniques.
The Personal Plan must include documentation of the individual's need for counseling and services.
A counseling strategy must be developed and approved in writing by the individual and/or guardian, if applicable. This plan should include:
- A brief summary describing the emotional, cognitive, or behavioral concerns to be addressed by counseling. The individual's goals for counseling should be identified. The description should note the frequency and severity of problem behaviors identified by others and the individual's attitude and perspective regarding the concerns of others
- For individuals who have a dual diagnosis with a mental illness or are taking psychoactive medications, there should be a summary of psychiatric diagnoses and medications that are currently being prescribed.
- Description of specific, person-centered counseling strategies to be provided by the counselor to assist the individual to meet the goals.
  
Each individual or group counseling contact requires a clinical narrative documenting the specific counseling service provided as well as the specific date and time the service was rendered. The counselor or psychotherapist must maintain documentation that reflects a brief description of the session's focus and periodic reviews of progress towards agreed upon treatment goals.  
Counseling includes:
- Participation in the Person-Centered Planning process and consultation with the ISC provider agency, guardian, if applicable, and family related to the individual's needs and goals for counseling supports, as well as previous attempts to address the individual's needs.
- The development of a strategy that outlines the provision of individualized counseling services.
- Assessing information on the frequency and severity of the individual's struggles and their capacity to identify their contribution.
- Individual face-to-face contacts addressing goals identified in the individual's counseling strategy.
- Collecting collateral data for use in treatment (cannot exceed 10% of billable time)  
Group counseling includes sessions in which the counselor meets with two or more individuals to address their individual goals identified in their individualized counseling plans.  
Counseling can be provided to individuals who are temporarily absent from, but will be returning to, their residential setting (SNF, Hospital, etc.) as long as the current temporary provider (SNF, Hospital, etc.) approves the counseling service to be provided in their location, the service is being provided and supporting documentation is maintained. Location of the service should be part of the supporting documentation.  
Since each counselor must enroll in IMPACT to provide services to waiver participants, billing for services must be done under the provider who provided the service.
