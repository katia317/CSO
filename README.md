## Adult Day Care (ADC) (35U)
Adult day care is available to individuals who are **aged 60 and older**. Individuals who are not yet 60 may also be served if day habilitation or employment services are determined by the person-centered planning not to be appropriate because the individual is medically fragile.
Adult day care services are generally furnished four or more hours per day on a regularly scheduled basis for one or more days per week, or as specified in the [Personal Plan](#personal-plan-pp), in a non-institutional, community-based setting, encompassing both health and social services needed to ensure the optimal functioning of the individual. Meals provided as part of these services shall not constitute a "full nutritional regimen" (three meals per day).
Transportation between the individual's place of residence and the adult day care center is provided as a component part of adult day care services. The cost of this transportation is included in the rate paid to providers of adult day care.
ADC provided in a setting is governed by the *Community Care Program rule 89 Ill*. Adm. Code 240 of the Department on Aging.
  See [X. Service Authorization and Prior Approval](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=144932) for prior approval requirements for adult day care.

All Kids also covers special services like medical equipment, speech therapy, and physical therapy for children who need them.

## Active Treatment (AT) for Individuals with a Developmental Disability  
A continuous program for each individual that includes aggressive, consistent implementation of a program for specialized and generic training, treatment, health services and related services that are directed toward:
- "The acquisition of behaviors necessary for the individual to function with as much self-determination and independence as possible.
- "The prevention or deceleration of regression or loss of current optimal functional status.
- "Active treatment does not include services to maintain generally independent individuals who are able to function with little supervision or in the absence of a continuous active treatment program."
  
<details>
  <summary><strong> Guidelines on assessment regarding the individual's needs for active treatment: </strong></summary>
  
- Does the individual require continuous programming to acquire new skills or maintain current ones? _("Continuous" is considered to mean that the necessary programming is provided whenever the behavior is needed, whether that is daily [e.g., training in bathing] or several times daily [e.g., feeding oneself]. It is not meant to include the need for continuous nursing services, continuous physical supports, continuous psychiatric or forensic services, continuous monitoring to prevent substance abuse, or other interventions that may also be provided on a continuous basis.)_
  
- Does the individual require aggressive and consistent programming in order to acquire new skills or maintain current ones? _("Aggressive" connotes the idea that staff will seek appropriate opportunities to provide the necessary programming and will not simply wait for the individual to ask for the needed service. "Consistent" suggests that a program must be administered in the same way by all staff, in all settings, at all times of the day.)_
  
- Does the individual require a program that includes specialized and generic training, treatment, health services and related services in order to acquire new skills or maintain current ones?

- Is the person able to function generally in an independent way, if not provided with supervision?
   
- Is the person able to function generally in an independent way, if not provided with active treatment?

## Alzheimer's Disease
Alzheimer's disease is a brain disorder that gets worse over time. It's characterized by changes in the brain that lead to deposits of certain proteins. Alzheimer's disease causes the brain to shrink and brain cells to eventually die. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of [dementia](#dementia) — a gradual decline in memory, thinking, behavior and social skills. These changes affect a person's ability to function. 

## Appeal Rights
If you have been denied eligibility, services, or have been terminated, suspended, or received a reduction of waiver-funded services, you have the right to ask that this decision be reconsidered.

## Appeals Process of PAS
Due process by which an individual may have the following determinations made during the Pre-Admission Screening process reviewed at another level.

## Bogard Consent Decree
Bogard class members are defined in the modified Bogard Consent Decree, Page 1, Section A., as *"all persons 18 years of age or older, with developmental disabilities, who, on or after March 23, 1986, resided in an Intermediate Care Facility or Skilled Nursing Facility in Illinois as a Medicaid recipient for a period of more than 120 days in the aggregate. No person first admitted to an Intermediate Care Facility or a Skilled Nursing Facility on or after April 1, 1994, can be a member of the class."* Bogard class members are designated by the Department of Human Services/Division of Developmental Disabilities.
  
Class members receive a specific form of case coordination directly related to their residential setting. These class members live in nursing facilities, nontraditional DD settings such as State Operated Mental Health Centers, shelter care homes, their own or family homes, apartments without DD services, and State Operated Developmental Centers. Bogard class members who are receiving waiver services such as Community Integrated Living Arrangements (CILA), Community Day Services (CDS) or Home-Based Support Services (HBS) as well as class members living in an Intermediate Care Facility for Persons with Developmental Disabilities (ICF/DD), not including State-Operated Developmental Centers, receive Individual Service and Support Advocacy. (For a description of ISSA, see Section 9 of this Manual.)
  
It is expected that Bogard class members develop new skills and maintain existing ones through specialized services or active treatment, receive adaptive equipment as appropriate, live in appropriate community-based residential settings if they so choose, and receive case coordination on a regular basis.
  
Independent Service Coordination (ISC) agency staff serve as the case coordinator for Bogard class members and are required to be a Qualified Intellectual Disabilities Professional (QIDP).
See [ISC Manual - Section 10: Bogard Consent Decree](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=115416#a_toc34) for more information
  
## Brain Stem Level Functioning
The individual is unable to control any part of or function of a bodily part from below the bottom of the brain stem. The individual may or may not have control of his or her respiratory system.

## C
## Cerebral Palsy (CP)
A physical condition involving permanent tightening of the muscles that is caused by damage to the brain around or before the time of birth (in Chinese: 脑性麻痹,脑性瘫痪). 

## Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
A federal agency that administers the nation’s major healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

## Child Group Home (17D)
Available to Children's Residential Waiver individuals and is a residential program licensed by the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to serve no more than 10 children per group home. Child Group Home services are individually tailored supports that assist with the acquisition, retention, or improvement in skills related to living in the community. Child Group Homes are designed to provide a structured environment and a range of habilitative and therapeutic services to children and adolescents who cannot reside in their own home.

## Children's Support Waiver
Provides Home-Based services and supports to children and young adults with developmental disabilities ages 3 through 21 who live in their family home. Children and young adults ages 3 to 21 can be in the Children's Support Waiver. They have an ANNUAL budget that is 2 times Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Individuals are able to use up to 4 times the monthly allotment of SSI in a month. The money that is not used in a month carries over until the end of the calendar year. For example, effective January 1, 2022, the monthly Individual Budget is $1,682 per month. For individuals in the Children's Support Waiver who choose to flex their spending, the monthly maximum will be $3,364. This means that if you did not spend your full allotment in some earlier months of the year, you can spend more than your monthly allotment in some later months of the year as long as you do not go above the annual spending limit. Said another way, if your spending exceeds your monthly allotment up in some of the early months, you will need to cut back on your spending in later months to meet your annual allotment limit. Money unspent at the end of the calendar year cannot be accessed in the next year. The annual maximum is $20,184. DDD releases an information bulletin each year with the new funding amounts.

## Comatose
An abnormally deep stupor occurring in illness or due to an injury. The individual cannot be aroused by external stimuli.

## Competitive Integrated Employment (CIE)
Competitive Integrated Employment is work that is performed on a full-time or part-time basis, including self-employment, for which an individual is compensated at or above minimum wage and not less than the customary rate paid by the employer for the same or similar work performed by other similarly situated employees who are not individuals with disabilities.
CIE includes equitable access to benefits and advancement opportunities. In order for employment to meet this threshold, individuals with disabilities must be eligible for the level of benefits and have opportunities for advancement that are similar to those for other employees who are not individuals with disabilities and who have similar positions.
CIE can only occur at integrated locations where employees with disabilities interact with other persons who are not individuals with disabilities (co-workers, supervisors, customers, general public) to the same extent as employees who are not individuals with disabilities and who are in comparable positions. Interaction must extend beyond job coaches or others who are associated with the provision of supports. Competitive Integrated Employment may occur in settings with a natural absence of customers or the general public such as work that occurs at a community business after traditional hours. As long as non-disabled workers in similar positions would have an equitable experience, the work could be considered integrated.
  
## Community Day Services (31C or 31U)
Community Day Services (CDS) is a day program option provided under the waiver that provides assistance with gaining, maintaining or improving skills and functioning. Services can reinforce skills or lessons taught in other settings and may include training and supports to help prevent or slow regression.
CDS (31C and 31U) takes place in a non-residential setting, separate from the individual's private residence or other residential living arrangement. It can be provided at a site certified by the Department (site based CDS) or in community locations where members of the general, non-disabled community typically congregate (non-site based).  

<details>
  <summary><strong> CDS Activities </strong></summary> 
  
CDS activities should promote greater independence and personal choice. Activities can include:
- Increasing capacity for independent living through increasing skills including fine and gross motor skills, problem solving, safety skills, activities of daily living, and adaptive skills to support positive behavioral health.
- Training in a specific skill (i.e., Use of personal technology or assistive devices) or learning about different topics, including topics of personal interest, self-determination and self-advocacy.
- Participating in experiences that coincide with an individual's interests.
- Engaging in community activities, groups, associations, classes or clubs to develop social networks.
- Discovering or participating in hobbies, leisure, or cultural interests in the community to promote personal health and wellness (i.e., Yoga class, walking group, etc.).
- Participating in formal and informal associations or community and/or neighborhood groups.
- Learning to navigate the local community, including learning to use public transportation and/or private transportation available in the local area.
- May enhance an individual's ability to engage in productive work activities through a focus on such habilitative goals as compliance, attendance, and task completion.
- Participating in Pre-vocational activities such as:
  - Job/career exploration (cannot be paid employment).
  - Exploring volunteer opportunities or volunteering in their community.
  - Supports to enhance the individual's capacity to work well with others, maintain adequate attendance, and complete delegated tasks
- Includes the reduction of choices and behaviors that potentially would interfere with attaining a productive role through feedback, guidance, and positive behavioral supports.
  
*Community Day Services does not include the following:*
- Special education and related services (as defined in Section 601 (16) and (17) of the individuals with Disabilities Education Act) which otherwise are available to the individual through a local education agency.
- Vocational rehabilitation services which otherwise are available to the individual through a program funded under Section 110 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
Providers of this service must maintain documentation which supports the billing for the services being provided. The documentation should include start time, stop time, location service was provided, description of service, and outcome.
Includes transportation between the residence and other community locations where day services occur. The cost of this transportation is included in the rate paid to providers of Community Day Services. Training and assistance in transportation usage are provided as needed. Services provided in community locations where members of the general community typically congregate (non-site based) will begin billing once the individual or group reaches the site of the first planned activity of the day and end when leaving the last activity planned for the day. If going to a community location, the provider does not need to first meet at a site based CDS location.

</details>
  
## Community Reporting System (CRS)
The PC-based system designed to be used for collecting and submitting required data to the Department of Human Services (DHS) by those community providers who have contracted with the Department to provide services for individuals.

## Community Integrated Living Arrangement (CILA)  
A living arrangement provided to Adult Waiver individuals in a group home, family home or apartment where eight or fewer unrelated adults with developmental disabilities reside under supervision of the community developmental services agency. Residents receive a comprehensive individualized array of residential habilitation, personal support services and supports under the direction of a community support team within the local agency.  

<details>
  <summary><strong> Three CILA Models </strong></summary> 

- **Twenty-Four Hour CILA (60D)**
These homes have on-site shift staff available during all times when individuals are present. Staff provide both scheduled and unscheduled supports and services as needed by individuals.
- **Host Family CILA (60D)**
  Host Family CILA serves individuals with developmental disabilities in their own residence. Host families consist of one or more persons who are unrelated to the individual with a developmental disability and who are under contract with the provider agency to provide host family services. No more than two individuals with developmental disabilities may reside with any single host family.
  The two support models are:
  - **Standard Host Family**: a residence where the paid care giver(s) live on a full-time basis. Either the paid care giver(s) or individual served own, lease or rent the residence.
  - **Comprehensive Host Family**: may house either full or part-time paid care giver(s) in which individuals other than shift staff employees provide more than 50% of the residential coverage. The individual(s), care giver(s) or provider agency own, lease or rent the residence.
    *The difference between Standard and Comprehensive models is shift employees routinely share supervision, care and training responsibilities with the host family care giver(s) in the Comprehensive model.*
- **Intermittent CILA (61H, 62H or 63H)**
Typically serves individuals whose Personal Plan documents they do not require 24-hour, on-site staff presence and documents the situations in which individuals may safely be away from direct staff supervision. 24-hour, on-site staffing is not funded through Intermittent CILA. Intermittent Residential services in apartments or family homes have staff available on call 24 hours per day. On-call staff are available to provide both scheduled and unscheduled supports and services as needed by the individuals served and as specified in each individual's [Personal Plan](#personal-plan-pp).  
  
</details>

## Community Living Facility (CLF)
Serves Adult Waiver participants in a licensed residential setting. A Community Living Facility is not a nursing or medical facility and, to be eligible under the waiver, serves no more than 16 adults. There are 9 CLFs in the state.
CLF are residential settings that provide guidance, supervision, training and other assistance to adults with disabilities. The goal of community living is to help residents move into more independent living arrangements and stay engaged in society. Community living facilities can be houses or apartments that offer semi-independence and personal freedom to residents.

## Conflict of Interest Free Case Management
The Federal government regulations require states to separate case management from service delivery. Case management cannot be done by someone who: is a relative of the person served, is a direct provider of service, has a financial interest in a provider, or is employed by a provider. Case managers perform eligibility determinations, develop the Personal Plan, help families find providers, and monitor services.

## Convalescent Care
The care involved and the gradual return to health after an acute illness. To be considered for convalescent care, the individual must be discharged from a hospital setting. Usually convalescent care is obtained in a nursing facility setting. On occasion, an ICF/MR may be able to provide such care.

## Counseling (Individual and Group) (57U or 57G)  
*Note: This service is available only in the Adult Waiver.*
Counseling is a treatment approach in which a licensed professional meets with one or more individuals in ongoing periodic formal sessions and uses relationship skills to promote the individuals' abilities to deal with daily living issues associated with their emotional, cognitive, or behavioral problems using a variety of supportive and re-education techniques.  

<details>
  <summary><strong> More Details </strong></summary> 
  
The Personal Plan must include documentation of the individual's need for counseling and services.
A counseling strategy must be developed and approved in writing by the individual and/or guardian, if applicable. This plan should include:
- A brief summary describing the emotional, cognitive, or behavioral concerns to be addressed by counseling. The individual's goals for counseling should be identified. The description should note the frequency and severity of problem behaviors identified by others and the individual's attitude and perspective regarding the concerns of others
- For individuals who have a dual diagnosis with a mental illness or are taking psychoactive medications, there should be a summary of psychiatric diagnoses and medications that are currently being prescribed.
- Description of specific, person-centered counseling strategies to be provided by the counselor to assist the individual to meet the goals.
  
Each individual or group counseling contact requires a clinical narrative documenting the specific counseling service provided as well as the specific date and time the service was rendered. The counselor or psychotherapist must maintain documentation that reflects a brief description of the session's focus and periodic reviews of progress towards agreed upon treatment goals.  
Counseling includes:
- Participation in the Person-Centered Planning process and consultation with the ISC provider agency, guardian, if applicable, and family related to the individual's needs and goals for counseling supports, as well as previous attempts to address the individual's needs.
- The development of a strategy that outlines the provision of individualized counseling services.
- Assessing information on the frequency and severity of the individual's struggles and their capacity to identify their contribution.
- Individual face-to-face contacts addressing goals identified in the individual's counseling strategy.
- Collecting collateral data for use in treatment (cannot exceed 10% of billable time)  
Group counseling includes sessions in which the counselor meets with two or more individuals to address their individual goals identified in their individualized counseling plans.  
Counseling can be provided to individuals who are temporarily absent from, but will be returning to, their residential setting (SNF, Hospital, etc.) as long as the current temporary provider (SNF, Hospital, etc.) approves the counseling service to be provided in their location, the service is being provided and supporting documentation is maintained. Location of the service should be part of the supporting documentation.  
Since each counselor must enroll in IMPACT to provide services to waiver participants, billing for services must be done under the provider who provided the service.
  
</details>

## Critical Incidents (CI)
Critical Incidents are the alleged, suspected, or actual occurrence of an incident when there is reason to believe the health or safety of an individual may be adversely affected or an individual may be placed at a reasonable risk of harm. CIRAS reports do not include abuse, neglect, or exploitation incidents. These allegations should continue to be reported to the appropriate agency; Department of Human Services' Office of the Inspector General (OIG), Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), Department on Aging / Adult Protective Services (APS), and/or Department of Public Health (IDPH).

<details>
  <summary><strong> Critical incidents are defined below </strong></summary> 
  
- **911 Call**: All calls to 911 for emergency personnel response that do not fit into any other category. Calls for emergency response that are initiated by persons receiving supports from the provider agency should be included here, even if they are later determined to be inappropriate. A description of the reason for the call should be included in the narrative. Calls to 911 for medical emergencies should be reported as "Medical emergency".
- **Deaths**: Deaths of participants who receive services while living in their own or family's home. Deaths of participants residing in residential settings are not reported as part of this data process since they are reported to OIG as per Rule 50.
- **Known injury**: A known injury is any injury from a known cause that is not considered abuse or neglect and that requires immobilization, casting, five or more sutures or the equivalent, second or third degree burns, dental injuries, eye injuries, or any injury that prohibits the individual from participating in routine daily tasks for more than two consecutive days. In some cases, an injury may not be immediately recognized as requiring reporting. A known injury becomes reportable at the point where there is recognition that it fits this definition.
- **Law enforcement**: Any incident that results in the individual being charged, incarcerated, or arrested. Calls to 911 for assistance that do not result in charges, arrest, or incarceration are not required to be reported in this category.
- **Medical emergency**: Any incident where emergency medical intervention is required to save an individual's life (e.g., Heimlich maneuver, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intravenous therapy for dehydration). Calls for 911 medical assistance should be reported as "medical emergency" even if the cause is other than the examples provided. A 911 call is not required for an issue to be reported as a "medical emergency". Issues that are resolved through intervention of agency staff that would have likely resulted in death if the action had not occurred should be reported.
- **Missing individual**: An incident that is not attributed to neglect, as define by Rule 50, and the individual cannot be located for a period of time longer than specified in the personal plan; the individual cannot be located after actions specified in the personal plan are taken; the individual cannot be located in a search of the immediate surrounding area; circumstances indicate that the individual may be in immediate jeopardy; or law enforcement has been called to assist in the search for the individual.
- **Peer-to-peer acts**: Acts committed by one individual against one or more individuals when there is physical abuse with intent to harm; verbal abuse with intent to intimidate, harass, or humiliate resulting in emotional distress or maladaptive behavior; any sexual abuse; any exploitation; or intentional misappropriation of property. In some cases, such incidents may need to be reported to OIG as potential staff neglect or exploitation, rather than reported in CIRAS. If peer-to-peer actions occur due to failure of staff to intervene to prevent or stop the act, a neglect report is appropriate. In cases where one individual is clearly the aggressor, it is acceptable to make only one CIRAS entry in the name of the aggressor, listing the name(s) of the victim(s) in the narrative. However, if two or more people become involved in an altercation that meets this definition and the aggressor is identified as multiple individuals, a separate CIRAS report should be completed for each aggressor.  Acts committed against staff should be reported in the "Peer-to-staff" option.
- **Peer-to-staff**: Acts committed by one individual against one or more staff members when there is physical abuse with intent to harm or verbal abuse with intent to intimidate, harass, or humiliate. In cases where one individual is clearly the aggressor, it is acceptable to make only one CIRAS entry in the name of the aggressor, listing the name(s) of the victim(s) in the narrative. However, if two or more people become involved in an altercation that meets this definition and the aggressor is identified as multiple individuals, a separate CIRAS report should be completed for each aggressor.
- **Unauthorized restraint**: Any use of restraint beyond the provisions outlined in Appendix G of each Waiver. Refer to Illinois Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code for details. (See 405 ILCS 5/1-125 and 405 ILCS 5/2-108 for details.)
- **Unknown injury**: Any injury of an unknown cause that is not considered possible abuse or neglect and that requires treatment that only a physician, physician's assistant, or nurse practitioner can provide. If the cause of the injury is known, follow instructions in KNOWN INJURY and/or MEDICAL EMERGENCY categories.
- **Unscheduled hospitalization**: Any hospital admission that is not scheduled in advance. Hospitalization admissions that occur as a result of a "Medical emergency" or "911 call" should not be reported in this category but should be reported in the appropriate category.

## [Critical Incident Reporting and Analysis System (CIRAS)](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=97101)
[Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD)](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=29761) has developed the Critical Incident Reporting and Analysis System (CIRAS) to capture electronic reports from ISC agencies as well as providers of certain incidents involving participants in the State's Medicaid Waiver programs for individuals with developmental disabilities. The types of incidents to be reported are listed and defined in the CIRAS Manual which is available on the DHS website. The DDD will use the information reported through CIRAS to:
- Inform ISC agencies of potential issues involving the participants whose general health and well-being the ISCs are monitoring,
- Ensure incidents are addressed appropriately, and
- Analyze potential systemic issues and take steps to enhance overall system quality.
   
CIRAS is not a reporting system for alleged incidents of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Alleged cases of abuse, neglect or exploitation should continue to be reported to the Department of Human Services' Office of the Inspector General (OIG), Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), Department on Aging / Adult Protective Services (APS), and/or Department of Public Health as appropriate and required in accordance with the type of service involved.  
As ISCs are informed of critical incidents, they will be the primary responder, will perform the appropriate follow-up and notify the Division of its findings. The ISC agencies are also CIRAS incident reporters. Being a reporter will allow ISC agencies to enter the incident in CIRAS, making the report complete a

A condition that is characterized by impairment in short-term or long-term memory, and one or more of the following: impairment in abstract thinking, judgement, higher cortical functions such as disturbances in language (aphasia), the completion of complex motor activities (apraxia), or the inability to recognize familiar objects (agnosis), or significant personality change.

## Determination Process of PAS
The final phase in the PAS process. Based on the completed assessments, determinations are made on the individual's need for 24-hour nursing care and the need for active treatment related to the disability. The need for 24-hour nursing care and active treatment, along with the individual's age and level of disability, establish the options available to the individual for alternative residential support services. If warrented, the DD PAS agency will refer an individual to the local MHPAS agency for determination of the need for psychiatric rehabilitation services.

## Dual Sensory Impairment
Concomitant hearing and visual impairments. The combination of these impairments causes such severe communication, mobility, developmental, self-care, or work-related problems that the individual cannot be accommodated in programs solely for individuals who have a hearing or visual impairment.

## E
## Enhanced Residential (formerly At-Home) Day Program (37U)
Enhanced Residential Day Program is part of the residential habilitation program for Adult Waiver individuals and based in the individual's CILA home. Enhanced Residential Day Program provides a structured, individualized program of in-home and community habilitation activities for individuals who are unable to participate in traditional, out-of-home community day service programs because the individual:
- Has an illness or medical condition(s) or severe maladaptive behavior(s) that prevent participation in a vocational or day habilitation programing;
- Is over the age of 60 and declines to participate in traditional, out-of-home day habilitation programing;
- Is unable to locate a traditional community day service program to serve him/her or the community day service program is not appropriate to meet his/her needs;
- Has chosen not to participate in traditional day habilitation services on a full or part-time basis.
  Because individuals receiving this service require supports not able to be met in a traditional CDS program, the staffing ratio for this service can vary between 1:1 and 1:3, support staff to participant. The amount of authorized support is identified on the rate determination form.
  Providers of this service must maintain documentation which supports the billing for the services being provided. The documentation should include start time, stop time, location service was provided, description of service, and outcome.

*__Note__: This service is available __only__ in the Adult Waiver Program.*
This service is available within the monthly maximum to individuals who are authorized for [Home-Based Support Services (HBS)](#the-home-based-services-hbs) within the Adult Waiver.
  
Emergency Home Response Services are limited to adults who live alone, or who are alone for significant parts of the day and have no regular caregiver for extended periods of time, and who would otherwise require extensive routine supervision.
  
Emergency home response service is an electronic device that enables Adult Waiver individuals to secure help in an emergency. The individual may also wear a portable help button to allow for mobility.
  
The system is connected to the individual's phone and programmed to signal a response center once the "help" button is activated. Installation, upkeep, and maintenance of devices/systems may be provided.
  
## Employer of Record (EOR)
Individual providers of Personal Support who are not employed by a provider agency receive ongoing supervision by the Employer of Record who is one person designated by the individual receiving waiver services and can be the individual and/or guardian, if applicable, other family member, or close associate.
  
The Employer of Record is the person who is ultimately responsible for ensuring wages are paid. They are also responsible for overseeing the services outlined in the monthly budget and signing Service Agreements, Service Authorizations, and time sheets. In addition, the Employer of Record may help with hiring, training, supervising, and firing PSWs.
  
The Employer of Record can be the individual receiving waiver services (if you do not have a guardian), a guardian (if they are not also your PSW), or other adult members of your family or a trusted associate. The Employer of Record can be the same person who is your Representative Payee for Social Security benefits. The Employer of Record can't also be a PSW.
  
If the individual or their family choose to hire PSWs directly, the F/EA will assist with the hiring process and be available for consultation if questions arise. The Division contracts with Avenues to Consumer Employer Services and $supports (ACES$) to provide F/EA services in Illinois. ACES$ will handle personal support worker new hire paperwork and payroll/tax functions. If you choose to hire your own PSWs, you must use ACES$. ACES$ is not the employer of the PSW, they only assist with the employer functions required by their contract with DDD.
  
The Employer of Record is responsible for signing timesheets. They can't pass this responsibility on to the ISC or Self Direction Assistant if they use this service.

*__Note__: This service is available in the Adult Waiver and the Children's Support Waiver.*
Home Accessibility Modifications include those physical adaptations to the private residence of the individual or the individual's family, required by the individual's personal plan, necessary to ensure the independence in the home and necessary repair to the adaptations.
Home accessibility modifications may be either permanent or not permanent. Permanent home modifications are either structural modifications or items attached to the home. All services must be provided in accordance with applicable State or local building codes.
For modifications to agency owned CILA sites, please see the [CILA User Guide](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=16043).
<details>
<summary><strong> Examples of Home Accessibility Modifications </strong></summary> 
  
- Ramps, lifts or elevators necessary to enter or leave the home or to access a bedroom or a bathroom, including porch or stair lifts and hydraulic, manual, or electric lifts.
- Bathroom modifications, including roll-in showers, sink modifications, bathtub modifications, toilet modifications, grab bars, adapted water faucet controls, floor urinal and bidet adaptations and plumbing modifications, and turnaround space adaptations.
- Widening of doorways/hallways (may include minimally necessary floor covering to cover the new floor area).

## Home and Community-Based Services Waivers (HCBS)
The HCBS Waivers fund services that prevent or delay living in a long-term care facility. Illinois operates three HCBS Waivers for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities: the Adult Waiver, the Children's Residential Waiver, and the Children's Support Waiver.

## The Home-Based Services (HBS) 
The Home-Based Services program is designed to enable participants to remain living in their family home or in the case of adults, a home of their own if feasible, while receiving services that support them to achieve their personal outcomes. The HBS program provides a monthly allocation that can be used to purchase services from authorized community agencies, or to pay for Personal Support Workers (PSW) who are directed by the individual or his/her designee.  
  
HBS resources can be used to purchase direct services such as Community Day Services and employment services from community agencies enrolled in the Medicaid Waiver program. An organization must have an authorized Medicaid contract with the state in order to have HBS resources pay for program services. Programs offered by park districts, health clubs and community colleges do not meet this criteria and cannot be paid for directly through the HBS program. Both the Children's and Adult HBS programs permit hiring family members to perform PSW duties, though the Children's HBS program does not permit parents or other legally responsible adults to provide such services, while the Adult HBS program does permit this option. The Adult HBS program prohibits spouse's or children from providing PSW services. Community agencies may also offer PSW services on an hourly fee basis.

Visit the [Home-Based Support Services (HBS) Information](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/Page.aspx?item=93376) Page for more details.

The Division currently funds 8 ISC agencies in 12 regions across the state.

## [Individualized Education Program (IEP)](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=36328)  
An Individualized Education Program is a plan that describes the special education instruction, supports, and services that students with disabilities are legally entitled to receive.  An IEP is developed by school staff members, the student's parents/guardians and the student (when appropriate). The required contents of an IEP are determined by the student's needs and age as well as federal and state laws.  
  <details>
<summary><strong> More Details </strong></summary>  
    
The public agency must ensure that the IEP Team for each child with a disability includes:  
1. The parents of the child
2. Not less than one regular education teacher of the child (if the child is, or may be, participating in the regular education environment)
3. Not less than one special education teacher of the child, or where appropriate, not less than one special education provider of the child
4. A representative of the public agency (who has certain specific knowledge and qualifications)
5. An individual who can interpret the instructional implications of evaluation results and who may also be one of the other listed members
6. At the discretion of the parent or the agency, other individuals who have knowledge or special expertise regarding the child, including related services personnel as appropriate
7. Whenever appropriate, the child with a disability  
    
In accordance with 34 CFR 300.321(a)(7), the public agency must invite a child with a disability to attend the child’s IEP Team meeting if a purpose of the meeting will be the consideration of the postsecondary goals for the child and the transition services needed to assist the child in reaching those goals under 34 CFR 300.320(b). [34 CFR 300.321(a) and (b)(1)] [20 U.S.C. 1414(d)(1)(B)]  
  
Parents are crucial in the special education process and the language of IDEA highlights this point. As the above indicates, many students also participate in their own IEP’s, particularly as they begin to plan transition. This is a very important way for students to build self-advocacy skills. Families can choose to bring others to the IEP with them. It’s important, however, to be courteous and notify the school of additional participants ahead of time. Some parents/guardians want a friend there for moral support and to take notes. Some choose to bring another person who knows the student and can contribute to the information used to develop a plan. Advocates are also sometimes invited by families to help them in the IEP process. It is at the IEP meeting that the IEP team decides how to implement the IEP.

## Individual Service and Support Advocacy (ISSA)
Individual Service and Support Advocacy (ISSA) is service coordination or case management to persons who are enrolled in a DDD Home and Community Based Service Waiver. This will include some individuals who are:

- Receiving Community Day Services (CDS).  
  
ISSA is also provided to Bogard class members who live in an [ICF/DD](#intermediate-care-facility-for-individuals-with-a-developmental-disability-icfdd). Through the provision of ISSA, the ISC represents the Department's interests in determining whether program services are being provided as outlined in the Personal Plan as well as monitoring the person's welfare, health and safety. ISSA is not optional; individuals, guardians or families must not refuse ISSA.

## Personal Support (PS) (55D)
*__Note__: This service is available in the Adult Waiver and the Children's Support Waiver.*
This service is available within the monthly maximum for individuals in the Adult Waiver and monthly and yearly maximum for all individuals in the Children's Support Waiver who are authorized for [Home-Based Support Services (HBS)](#the-home-based-services-hbs).
The Waiver affords individuals the opportunity to direct their services through employer authority and budget authority. The individual exercises choice and control over the personal support workers who provide services. Individuals and/or their guardians, if applicable, exercise decision-making authority and management responsibility for their budgets. Within the overall cost limit, the individuals determine the type and amount of services to be purchased and establish rates for their personal support workers.  
<details>
<summary><strong> More Details about PS </strong></summary> 
  
Individuals are supported to direct their own services by the following entities:  
- Independent Service Coordination (ISC) Agencies conduct case management services as an administrative activity under the Waiver, including person centered planning development and monitoring;
- A fiscal employer agency (FE/A) that provides Financial Management Services as an administrative activity under the Waiver, including making payments on behalf of the employer, completing required tax and other withholding and documentation. If an individual hires their own PSW(s), they must use the FE/A. The F/EA provides assistance with provider enrollment, payroll processing, and billing for domestic employees;
- A Self-Direction Assistant (SDA), if selected, can assist the individual and/or guardian, if applicable, in arranging for, directing and managing services. The SDA, if utilized, and fiscal employer/agent (FE/A) are available to assist with these responsibilities if the individual or family needs such assistance;
- An individual may be involuntarily restricted from self-directed services due to any of the following circumstances:
  - The Division of Developmental Disabilities determines the individual and/or his or her employer of record have committed fraud regarding participant-directed program funds;
  - The individual is living with a family member or other individual who has been determined by Adult Protective Services or other authorized entity (e.g., law enforcement) to have abused or neglected the participant or other individuals; or
  - The ISC agency and FE/A have determined and documented the individual and/or his or her employer of record are not able to direct their own services.
    
This restriction of self-directed services is subject to appeal. The outcome of the appeal process is final. In this event, agency-directed services would be made available and documented in the Personal Plan. The ISC works to ensure service continuity and health and welfare during the transition.

Personal Support services include a range of training and assistance to enable individuals to accomplish tasks they would normally do for themselves if they did not have a disability. These services may include:

- Teaching adaptive skills to assist the individual to reach personal goals.
- Personal assistance in activities of daily living.
- Assistance in performing age-appropriate housekeeping chores such as bed making, dusting and vacuuming, which are essential to the health and welfare of the individual, rather than for the individual's family.
- Services provided on a short-term basis because of the absence or need for relief of the primary caregivers.
  
Personal Support services may be provided on an episodic or on a continuing basis. Health-related services may include skilled or nursing care as an extension of behavioral and therapy services. The PSW can assist the individual to implement a behavioral, occupational therapy, physical therapy, or speech therapy plan to the extent permitted by state law, as prescribed in the PCP, and as trained on by the healthcare professional who developed the plan. Implementation activities include assistance with exercise routines, range of motion, reading the therapist's directions, helping the individual remember and follow the steps of the PCP or hands-on assistance. It does not include the actual service the professional therapist provides. PSWs should not administer medications as this is not permitted by State law.
  
Personal Support may be provided in the individual's home and may include supports necessary to participate in generic community activities outside the home. Individuals may not receive Personal Support services during the typical school day relative to the age of the individual or during times when educational services are being provided.
  
Personal Support may include supports provided to an individual while hospitalized in order to foster communication, provide intensive personal care, and/or promote behavioral stabilization for the purpose of smooth transitions or preserve functional abilities. These are services in the Personal Plan that cannot be provided by hospital staff and are not a substitute for services the hospital is obligated to provide through its conditions of participation or under Federal or State law, or under another applicable requirement. Services in the Personal Plan that cannot be provided by hospital staff will be provided by the Personal Support Worker.
  
The need for Personal Support and the scope of the needed services must be documented in the Personal Plan. The service authorizations must specify the monthly number of hours of Personal Support and the hourly rate. The hourly rates are subject to review and approval by the Division on either a targeted or a random sample basis.  
  
Personal Support is __NOT__ intended to:
  
- Include professional services, home cleaning services, recreation fees, or other community services used by the general public.
- Provide one-to-one supports in a day program. An enhanced day program rate may be requested as necessary to meet this need within the monthly maximum.
Personal Support is a service provided on a 1:1 basis based on the needs in the Personal Plan. However, if more than one individual wishes to receive services from one PSW during a community outing, they can negotiate a rate with the PSW and share the services. All individuals should receive equal services and all health and safety concerns should be addressed prior to the outing.
  
All Personal Support providers, whether agencies or personal support workers, must comply with the same timekeeping requirements as providers of other waiver services.

## Psychotherapy (Individual and Group) (58U or 58G)  
*Note: This service is available __only__ in the Adult Waiver*  
Psychotherapy is a treatment approach in which a licensed provider engages with one or more individuals seen simultaneously, if applicable, in ongoing periodic formal sessions with the goal of reducing the symptoms of emotional, cognitive, or behavioral distress and promoting positive emotional, cognitive, behavioral development, and individual goals. The therapeutic approach should utilize evidence-based approaches, appropriate for supporting the individual's goals and/or addressing self-defeating choices or behavior.  
<details>
<summary><strong> More Details </strong></summary> 
  
The person-centered planning team must recommend psychotherapy prior to the individual receiving services. The Personal Plan must include documentation of an individual's goals, how psychotherapy would help them attain those goals and the services to be provided by the licensed Psychotherapist.  
- A psychotherapy plan must be developed in writing within 45 days of initial contact. This plan should include:
- A brief description of the individual's goals and emotional, cognitive, or behavioral concerns to be addressed by therapy. The description should note the frequency and severity of any problem behaviors, as well as previous attempts to address the concerns.
- If the individual is dually diagnosed with a mental illness or is taking psychoactive medications, a summary of psychiatric diagnoses and medications and their effectiveness on symptoms or target behaviors should be summarized.
- A description of person-centered, specific, measurable goals that will be addressed by therapy. Goals should include time frames for estimated attainment.
- A description of specific, person-centered therapeutic strategies to be provided by the therapist to assist the individual to meet the goals.  
Each individual or group therapy contact requires a clinical narrative documenting the specific therapy service provided as well as the specific date and time the service was rendered. The clinical psychologist must maintain documentation that reflects a brief description of the session's focus and periodic reviews of progress toward established therapy goals for each individual.
  
*Psychotherapy incudes:*

Group therapy includes sessions in which therapist meets with two or more individuals to address goals identified in their individualized psychotherapy plans.   
Therapy can be provided to individuals who are temporarily absent from, but will be returning to, their residential setting (SNF, Hospital, etc.) as long as the current temporary provider (SNF, Hospital, etc.) approves the therapy service to be provided in their location, the service is being provided and supporting documentation is maintained. Location of the service should be part of the supporting documentation.  
Since each therapist must enroll in IMPACT to provide services to waiver participants, billing for services must be done under the provider who provided the service.

## [PUNS for Persons with Developmental Disabilities (PUNS)](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=115416#a_toc7)
PUNS is a database that registers individuals who want or need DDD Waiver services. People that are interested in receiving services through an ICF/DD should work with the ISC agency to explore potential ICF/DD providers. Individuals can still seek placement on PUNS while exploring ICF/DDs. At the time of enrollment into the database, the ISC must explain all service options available to the person. ISCs can use the [Illinois PUNS Form - Enrollment Tool](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/OneNetLibrary/27897/documents/DD/PUNsTool082718.pdf). 
<details>
<summary><strong> 2 categories of PUNS database </strong></summary>  
  
A. The **Seeking Services** category is for people who currently need or desire supports and are in any of the following situations:  
  
- Persons whose caregiver is clearly progressing toward being unable to provide care for any number of reasons (age of the caregiver, physical/psychological/health condition of caregiver, health or other situation of the individual). The individual and/or family are coping for now but supports are needed.
- The individual him/herself has a deteriorating situation, which requires formal supports.
- Cases where, although the caregiver and person with developmental disabilities have not been directly affected, a death in the family (especially of a care giver's spouse or other family member who may have assisted in providing care) or other circumstance has affected their situation requiring a need for additional support.
- Situations where the caregiver(s) must work to provide income to pay the rent, etc. If services are not provided, the caregiver(s) would have to remain at home to provide support, and effectively be unable to continue working.
- Persons who have (or will shortly) graduate from school and will need day supports (i.e., there are no other employment or other day support options available/planned).
- Person is dissatisfied with current setting and would like to have DD residential services.
- Person prefers to live in his/her own home rather than in a funded residential setting but would need supports to do so.
- Person currently lives in out-of-home residential setting that is not funded by the Division of DD and wishes to return to their family home (and family concurs). The family is capable of providing care but would like support to return this person to the home.

B. The **Planning for Services** category is for people who do not currently want or need supports but may in the future. It is helpful to know about these situations even though the person/family is not seeking services now. The Planning for Services category is for persons who are not currently seeking services but will be seeking if something happens to the caregiver (e.g. caregiver becomes ill or passes away) or other family circumstances change. It is also appropriate for persons who currently receive funding or services through entities other than DD, and whose eligibility will be terminating primarily due to the age of the individual. This person is not in crisis and does not have a current need or desire for DD services. This might include, but is not limited to, persons who are funded through:  
  
- Early, Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) program
- Medically Fragile/Technology Dependent Children's Waiver
- Individual Care Grant supports through the mental health system
- Illinois State Board of Education or public school system.  
</details>  
PUNS selections for Waiver services will occur as funding is available. Selections will be based on a person's cumulative length of time in the Seeking Services Category after age 18. Selections will not be made from the Planning for Services category. If the individual enrolled in PUNS before turning age 18, the length of time begins calculating on the individual's 18th birthday provided that they are in the Seeking service category.  In order to move from one category to the other, individuals and/or guardian must notify their ISC. Movement from one category to the other is not automatic.  
  
Children may be enrolled on PUNS beginning at age __2.5__. Children should be placed in the category appropriate to their situation-Seeking Services or Planning for Services. If funding is identified to do a PUNS selection for the children's waivers, selection will be based on a child's cumulative length of time in the Seeking Services category __prior to age 18__; again, selections will not be made from the Planning for Service category.  

## Q

- It is manifested before the individual reaches age 22.
- It is likely to continue indefinitely.
- It results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major life activity:
  - Self-care

## Remote Supports (53E and/or 53T)
*__Note__: This service is available in the Adult Waiver to individuals receiving CILA services.*
a. Remote Support includes the use of video, audio, door and window monitoring devices, or other technology which enables an individual to be more independent and less reliant on staff being physically present when receiving CILA supports and services. The use of remote supports will be considered on an individual, case-by-case basis when an individual and guardian, if applicable, requests the service and the Independent Service Coordination agency and provider support team agree it is appropriate and meets the health and safety needs of the individual. Remote Support requires prior approval and may only be used with full consent of the individual, guardian, if applicable, and anyone else residing in the same living space. Remote Support is limited to CILA participants. The use of this service is not intended to replace an individual's ability or right to engage with the community.
b. The type of equipment and where it is placed will depend upon the needs and wishes of the individual(s) and their guardian(s), if applicable, the layout and construction of the home, and the company selected by the individual(s) or guardian(s), if applicable, to provide the equipment. The installation of video/audio equipment in the home will be done at the direction of the individual(s). If the home is shared with others, the equipment will be installed in such a manner that it does not invade others' privacy. The remote device is controlled by the waiver individual and can be turned on or off as needed. Video equipment for remote support monitoring cannot be placed in invasive areas, such as bedrooms or bathrooms, in accordance with 42 CFR Section 441.301(c)(4)(iii) for 1915(c) and 42 CFR Section 441.710(a)(1)(iii) for 1915(i).
c. Purchased or leased equipment, an initial installation fee, ongoing monthly rental charges and upkeep and maintenance of the devices are covered under this service.

## S
## Scales of Independent Behavior (SIB)

## Self-Direction Assistance (SDA) (55A)
*__Note__: This service is available to individuals in the Children's Support Waiver and Adult Waiver Programs. The acronym SDA is used to describe the service (Self-Direction Assistance) as well as the provider agency staff (Self-Direction Assistant).*  
Self-Direction Assistance is a waiver service provided by a Self-Direction Assistant (SDA).  
Self-Direction Assistance assists the individual, guardian, if applicable, and/or family in arranging for, directing and managing Home Based Support services. It also offers practical skills training to enable individuals, guardian, if applicable, and/or families to independently direct and manage Waiver services. SDA includes providing information to ensure individuals understand the responsibilities involved with directing their services. SDA can assist the Employer of Record (EOR) with the process of timekeeping for PSWs, but they can't replace the responsibility of the EOR. In other words, the EOR must complete and sign the timesheets of the individual's PSW(s) and the SDA can review for accuracy and completion, but the SDA can't complete the timesheets on behalf of the EOR. Additionally, the SDA can't sign the timesheet in place of the EOR. If an SDA provider is also a PSW provider agency, the SDA provider can't provide the same services as the PSW provider agency. In this scenario, the SDA should not be assisting the individual, guardian, if applicable, and/or family with arranging for and directing PSW services because the PSW agency is already completing this process. SDA is only available to those in the [Home-Based Support Services (HBS)](#the-home-based-services-hbs) program and should not duplicate the services provided by the ISC.
  
SDA is an optional service, meaning individuals, guardians, if applicable, and/or families are not required to purchase this support. Provider agency staff fulfilling the role of the SDA are required to be Qualified Intellectual Disability Professionals (QIDPs). SDAs do not have a mandated set of services they are required to provide. If an individual, guardian, if applicable, and/or family desires or needs the support of an SDA, this must be documented in the Personal Plan, including the amount and frequency of services. The details of what SDAs provide to an individual, guardian, if applicable, and/or family must be based on the desired outcomes as well as the needs of the individual reflected in the Personal Plan. Services provided and billed must be within the description outlined in XII. Waiver Activity and Service Billing Guidance. All billable services must be agreed upon by the individual, guardian, if applicable, and/or family, as well as the SDA.
  
The cost of SDA services comes from the individual's monthly HBS allotment and must be reflected through an HBS Service Agreement. There is no monthly minimum for SDA. The maximum billable amount for an individual must remain within the monthly allotment. Providers may negotiate additional hours if necessary. SDA must be billed through the Reporting of Community Services (ROCS) using the bill code 55A. The most current rate can be found on the [DHS website](http://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=109260)
  
Monthly notes, often referred to as Q or QIDP Notes, are not required when providing SDA services. SDA provider agencies must comply with the same timekeeping requirements as providers of other waiver services. They must document date, start time, stop time, individual served and service provided. This documentation must be maintained in the individual's record.  
The [Self Direction Assistance Guidelines](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=93863) can be found online.  

## Severe Mental Illness
According to the Screening Assessment Rule (89 Illinois Administrative Code 140.642), an individual is considered to have a severe mental illness if he or she has one of the following diagnoses: schizophrenia; delusional disorder; schizoaffective disorder; psychotic disorder not otherwise specified; bipolar disorder I - mixed, manic, and depressed; bipolar disorder II; cyclothymic disorder; bipolar disorder not otherwise specified; major depression, recurrent; and due to his or her mental illness exhibits resulting substantial functional limitations. The functional limitation must be of an extended duration expected to be present for at least a year, which results in substantial limitation in major life activities affecting at least two of the following areas: i) self-maintenance; ii) social functioning; iii) community living activities; iv) work related skills.

## Shelter Care

It is typically conducted by a licensed professional known as a *speech-language pathologist (SLP)* or *speech therapist*. The therapy helps individuals of all ages who may have difficulty with speaking, understanding language, or using their voice properly.

## Service Authorization
A written document between you and an independently hired PSW outlining the terms of the services to be provided including the effective date, the rate of payment, the maximum units of service to be provided each month and the maximum monthly charge. Service Authorizations must be updated if there is a change in service and copies of the revised Service Authorization must be sent to the Fiscal/Employer Agent (F/EA). If you pay for Self-Direction Assistance (SDA) services, your SDA assist you or do this for you. If you do not use SDA services, you must do this yourself. F/EA, ACCES$, can help to support you if you have questions.
